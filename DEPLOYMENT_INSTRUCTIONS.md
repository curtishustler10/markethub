## 📋 Required Database Setup

### Step 1: Import Sample Market Data
Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- File: create_sample_markets.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ 4 market organizer profiles
- ✅ 8 sample markets across Brisbane/Gold Coast
- ✅ Upcoming events for each market
- ✅ Realistic amenities and requirements

### Step 2: Import Vendor Data (Optional)
If you want to populate vendor data, run:

```sql
-- File: import_all_vendors_fixed.sql  
```

This imports 200+ vendors from your CSV data.

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Mapbox Token (Optional but Recommended)
To enable full interactive map functionality:

1. Get a Mapbox token from [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
2. Add to your environment variables:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.your_actual_token_here
   ```

**Without Mapbox token:** The app shows a functional fallback UI that directs users to the markets page.
