### Step 3: Verification Queries
```sql
-- Check total imported vendors
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_imported_vendors
FROM profiles 
WHERE email LIKE '%@imported-vendor.markethub.com';

-- Check category distribution
SELECT 
    vp.category,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM vendor_profiles vp
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = vp.vendor_id
WHERE p.email LIKE '%@imported-vendor.markethub.com'
GROUP BY vp.category
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Sample of imported data
SELECT 
    p.name,
    vp.category,
